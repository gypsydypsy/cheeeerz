                    <p>We believe in the art of mixing liquids together, may it be a fancy party cocktail or a comforting  hazelnut cappucino. We are intimately convinced that a skillfully mixed beverage can make any situation better.</p>
                    <p>This wonderfull collection of cocktail recipes is kindly (and freely!) brought to you by <a href='https://www.thecocktaildb.com/' target='_blanck'>The Cocktail Db.</a></p>
